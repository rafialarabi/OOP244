Completing this workshop, I have learned various valuable things of C++. Firstly, I have learned how to dynamically
 allocate objects and generating more memory spaces when program needed. Secondly, using custom types is another 
important part that I have learned while doing this workshop. We used custom type so that it could contain some 
attribute or data members and we also had to declare a struct for that. Also, we learned how to declare ‘Boolean’ 
function in programs which only returns value of ‘true’ or ‘false’ and basically, this is quite new for me which 
I have never used or taught.  Until doing this workshop I was not so confident about pointer but after finishing 
this workshop now I am better in using pointer than before. Eventually, there is a big part of this program which 
is done by pointer. Though, it took me many hours to get done but after all, I have gained most of this workshop.
